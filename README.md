# **Employee Performance Analysis**
*INX Future Inc.*

Instructions
1. The Project Scenario are not based on actual organizations. Any similarities to known organizations are coincidental.
2. Read the Project Scenario and requested insights carefully.



**INX Future Inc Employee Performance - Project**
INX Future Inc , (referred as INX ) , is one of the leading data analytics and automation solutions provider with over 15 years of global business presence. INX is consistently rated as top 20 best employers past 5 years. INX human resource policies are considered as employee friendly and widely perceived as best practices in the industry.
Recent years, the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing concerns among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points.
CEO, Mr. Brain, knows the issues but concerned to take any actions in penalizing non-performing employees as this would affect the employee morale of all the employees in general and may further reduce the performance. Also, the market perception best employer and thereby attracting best talents to join the company.
Mr. Brain decided to initiate a data science project , which analyses the current employee data and find the core underlying causes of this performance issues. Mr. Brain, being a data scientist himself, expects the findings of this project will help him to take right course of actions. He also expects a clear indicators of non performing employees, so that any penalization of non-performing employee, if required, may not significantly affect other employee morals.
The following insights are expected from this project.
1. Department wise performances
2. Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance
3. A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees
4. Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.

# Conclusion and Recommendation

    Within all the five models Three model gives more accuracy score followed closely by K-Nearest Neighbors and ANN
    While ANN had the lowest performance.
    ie; Here the best model is
        1.Decision Tree
        2.Random Forest
        3.Gradient Boosting
        4.XG-Boost

** so we have to go with 1.Decision Tree Random Forestprediction **

Establish measurable goals and milestones to track progress. Clearly define performance expectations and objectives for the employee. Collaborate with the employee to develop a personalized action plan for development. When discussing performance improvement with an employee, it's crucial to maintain a respectful and constructive dialogue. Focus on providing support, guidance, and opportunities for growth to help the employee reach their full potential. Because

In conclusion, this project has provided valuable insights into which factors influencing employee performance, with implications for devloper and senior devloper Moving forward, it is essential to hire employee according to model file (In Which I saved the model). have to hire more employee who left job in department.
